# Comments and Test using `react-testing-library`

This project was made following the @Luke Ghenco's post at medium. It was just for fun and to learn how `react-testing-library` works

### Note
I followed the entire post, but I did some improvements using react hooks, react functional components and some `react-testing-library` methods were different from the original post due to the versions used.
